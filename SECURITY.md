## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
# Import necessary libraries
import hashlib
import uuid

# Get device ID
device_id = uuid.getnode()

# Generate security code
security_code = hashlib.sha256(str(device_id).encode()).hexdigest()

# Define crypto wallet
class CryptoWallet:
    def __init__(self, device_id, security_code):
        self.device_id = device_id
        self.security_code = security_code
        self.private_key = None

    def generate_private_key(self):
        self.private_key = hashlib.sha256(str(self.device_id).encode()).hexdigest()

    def send_transaction(self, recipient, amount):
        if self.private_key is None:
            raise ValueError("Private key not generated.")
        # Send transaction

# Create crypto wallet
wallet = CryptoWallet(device_id, security_code)

# Generate private key
wallet.generate_private_key()

# Send transaction
wallet.send_transaction("recipient_address", 10.0)
